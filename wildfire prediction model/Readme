## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
This model forecasts the likelihood of wildfire events and assesses related risk factors like fuel moisture and duff moisture codes. By analyzing key environmental factors, it aims to provide a proactive tool for managing wildfire risks.

## ðŸ§  Algorithms and Accuracy
- **Classification Model**: Gradient Boosting Classifier
  - **Accuracy**: 90%
  - We chose Gradient Boosting for its superior balance of precision and recall compared to other models like Random Forest and Logistic Regression.
  
- **Regression Model**: Gradient Boosting Regressor
  - **RÂ² Score**: 0.92
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 2.87
  - The model handles non-linear relationships in data effectively, making it ideal for continuous variable predictions like fire spread potential.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Parameters
The model is trained on the following environmental factors:
- **Temperature**
- **Wind Speed**
- **Fuel Moisture Code (FMC)**
- **Duff Moisture Code (DMC)**
- **Initial Spread Index (ISI)**

These parameters are essential as they influence both fire ignition and behavior.

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics
- **Classification Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- **Regression Metrics**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), RÂ²

Our evaluations identified Gradient Boosting models as the top performers for both classification and regression, ensuring reliable predictions for wildfire management.
